🌐 Git and GitHub Workflow

  1. Initialized a Git repo: git init

  2. Tracked your files: git add .

  3. Committed changes: git commit -m "Initial commit"

  4. Created a GitHub repo and linked it: git remote add origin ...

  5. Pushed to GitHub: git push -u origin main

Now your project lives both locally and online on GitHub.
